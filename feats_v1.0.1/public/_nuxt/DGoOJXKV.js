You can add, edit, and delete rides and routes, view statistics, and configure the application to your liking. The application consists of five pages: Rides (which is also the home page), Routes, Statistics, Configuration, and About.</p><p class="mb-4">The Rides page allows you to keep track of your completed rides, including details such as date, distance, average speed, and notes. The Routes page is for planning future rides, where you can save the route name, distance, and notes. The Statistics page provides insights into your riding habits and achievements. The Configuration page allows you to customize the application settings, such as the bikes you ride and other preferences.</p><h2 class="text-xl pt-4 mb-3 font-semibold">Rides page</h2><p class="mb-4">On the Rides page, you can add a new ride by filling out the form and clicking the &quot;Add&quot; button. You can also edit a single existing ride or delete multiple existing rides.<br><br> In de &#39;Reference&#39; field you can add a URL to the route on an external bicycle platform like RWGPS, Komoot or Strava, and in the &#39;Link&#39; field you can add a short text that will appear as a clickable link in the table below.<br><br> In the Columns section, you can choose which columns to show in the table, and you can also sort the table by clicking on the column headers. Note that hidden columns, although not visible, are also included in a search. </p><h2 class="text-xl pt-4 mb-3 font-semibold">Routes page</h2><p class="mb-4">The Routes page is similar to the Rides page, but it is for planning future rides.</p><h2 class="text-xl pt-4 mb-3 font-semibold">Statistics page</h2><p class="mb-4">The Statistics page provides insights into your riding habits and achievements. For me personally, it helps to track my progress and set new goals (as in: I want to ride more kilometers this month than the same month last year).</p><h2 class="text-xl pt-4 mb-3 font-semibold">Configuration page</h2><p class="mb-4">The Configuration page allows you to customize the application settings, such as the bikes you ride and other preferences. You can add, edit, and delete bikes, and you can also choose which columns to show in the Rides and Routes tables.<br><br> This page also includes a backup feature, which allows you to export your data as a SQL file. This is useful for creating backups of your data, or for transferring your data to another device. Note that the backup is currently limited to 10.000 records per table. </p><h2 class="text-xl pt-4 mb-3 font-semibold">About page</h2><p class="mb-4">This is the page you are currently on. It provides information about the application, its features, and its version history.</p><h2 class="text-2xl pt-8 mb-3 font-semibold">Version History</h2><h3 class="font-semibold">v1.0.0, 23-02-2026</h3><ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside"><li>First nuxt build</li><li>Moved database location to OS specific user directory</li><li>Some minor fixes</li></ul><h3 class="font-semibold">v0.9.2, 18-02-2026</h3><ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside"><li>Added table &#39;Rides over 100km&#39; on the Statistics page</li><li>Enabled multiple selection in Rides and Routes tables for bulk deletion</li><li>Fixed some dark mode contrast/color issues</li><li>Updated logo for dark mode</li><li>Some other minor improvements</li></ul><h3 class="font-semibold">v0.9.1, 14-02-2026</h3><ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside"><li>Added &#39;Monthly Totals by Year&#39; table on Statistics page</li><li>Many small improvements and bug fixes</li></ul><h3 class="font-semibold mt-6">v0.9.0, 11-02-2026</h3><ul class="mb-4 list-disc list-inside"><li>Initial version: Rides, Routes, Statistics, Configuration, About pages and SQLite backend for data storage</li></ul>',23))]))}});export{f as default};
