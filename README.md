# Feats

Feats is a Nuxt 4 app for tracking completed bicycle rides and planned routes.

It is a personal project to have a simple tool to keep track of my rides and routes. It is not intended to be a full-featured application, but rather a simple and easy-to-use tool for myself and anyone else who might find it useful. I used multiple bicycle platforms over the years and thought it would be handy to have a centralized place to have an overview of all my rides and routes.

## Quick start
You can clone or download the complete repository with all the source files and play around with it or just run the latest build in folder **feats_v[version number]**. In either way you need to have 'nodejs' installed on your system.

### Play with the source files
1. Clone (or download) the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
cd feats
npm install
```

2. Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

### Run the latest build

1. Clone (or download) the repository and copy the latest build to the destination of your choice, install the dependencies and run the app. Once you have copied the build, you can safely delete the original repository if you want.

```bash
cd feats_v[version number]/server
npm install
node ./index.mjs
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser.
